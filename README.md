# WasteNotWantNot
2nd Year Mobile Application Development Coursework

My application, named Waste Not Want Not is aimed towards people working 
to living a zero-waste lifestyle. A zero-waste lifestyle aims to minimise the amount of 
waste produced to an absolute minimum. Currently we are seeing trends of zero-waste 
lifestyles becoming more and more popular through the use of social media such as 
Instagram. However, when new to the lifestyle movement it can be difficult to 
determine how and where to shop in order to reduce non-recyclable plastic waste, 
especially when living outside of London where there is limited access to bulk food 
stores, that are commonly the best way of zero-waste shopping. My app aims to make 
this lifestyle more accessible by creating a platform to allow users to search for items 
and view stores nearby in which they can buy this item with the itemâ€™s rating of 
recyclability at each store.
